# montunolito
WIP : tool to generate procedural montuno (salsa music)

dependencies: python 3.5 (or more recent) and PyQt5 (for the applications only)

- montunolito:
is a python librairy. It contains 3 packages
  - core:
  All the modules necessary to generate, parse and iterate chord grid and rythmic pattern.  That all the montuno procedurale generation.
  - converters:
  Collection of packages who can read an array of data generated by the montunolito and convert it in other readable format. Currently only the music xml converter for musescore is done.
  - patterns:
  this package contains some pattern already harcoded. All submodule are preloaded in the package root in a constant dict: PATTERNS
  e.g. to get access them:
```python
  from montunolito.patterns import PATTERNS
```
- applications:
	This package contains very wip user interface to edit the rythmic patterns and the chord grids.
- test:
the package contains all the unit test already written for the other package. It's not complete, but it cover a big part of the montunolito who are a sensitive package and logic to debug



##### montunolito.core
The core contains the algorythms to generate a keyboard sequence. To generate those sequence, the montunolito combine to elements constructed by the user : the pattern and the chordgrid.

- fingerstate:
  Is a list of five booleans representing the finger. From the thumb to pinky, if the state is True, the finger press a keyboard touch. Else, it's off.  All the possible fingerstates are stored in the constant :
```python
montunolito.core.solfege.FINGERSSTATES
```
- figure:
  A figure is a combinaison off fingerstates as eighth. Thats store as list of indexes. The indexes are the fingerstate index from the constant FINGERSSTATES
- pattern:
    The pattern give the rythmic behavior and the finger used on keyboard per eighth. The pattern contains 3 elements, a figure's table, a figure relationship's table and a list of melodic behavior type coeficient per figure.
